                        <!--First section-->
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What are Interaction patterns</h2>
                        <p>One of the many features which makes a VR experience enjoyable and of high quality are the interactions between the user and the virtual environment, 
                            these are known as the interaction patterns. An example would be different ways of picking up an object and resizing it. With the help of camera, sensor, and controller information, 
                            it is possible to try and make the movements as natural as currently possible.</p>                            
                        <p>To be able to properly interact with the object it is required for them to have the physics properties, this means they are touchable, can fall due to gravity, objects can be thrown, etc.</p>
                        <p>There is not one pattern that fulfills all needs, which would be quite difficult to implement, therefore it is important to know what you need your application to do and knowledge 
                            about the patterns that are available and their appropriate uses. There are a variety of available interaction patterns, however some of the patterns depend on the capabilities of 
                            the VR glasses and the software being used. The patterns will be described in the next section.</p>
                        <!--Types of Interaction Patterns-->
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The types of Interaction Patterns</h2>                        
                        <!-- Selection Pattern-->
                        <h3 class="post-subtitle">Selection Patterns</h3> 
                        <h4 class="post-subtitle">Hand Selection </h4>
                        <p>This can use both physical hands and tracked controllers. In hand selection, the hand actions are mimicked, meaning the object to be interacted with needs to be in hands reach and they can be directly touched and picked up with the virtual hands.
                            It can also be possible to reach an object that is at a further distance by using a controller to extend the virtual hand in a linear manner to then interact with it.
                            A good practice for this pattern is to calculate or input the users arm length, which gives the user a more natural feel to the interaction. This can be done by asking the user to hold out the hands in front of the body when the application is started, however this is usually done automatically by the headset.                            
                        </p> </br>
                        <h4 class="post-subtitle">Pointing Selection </h4>
                        <p>It is the method in which selection or interaction with an object is done by pointing at it with an input device such as a controller or hand tracking. It is often time used with combination of rays casting, which is the mathematical calculation which defines a line in a 3D space.
                            The ray is casted from the input device and the selected object is determined by the intersection between the ray and the object in the virtual environment.
                            There are 2 main ways in which point selection can be implemented:
                        </p> 
                        <ul>
                            <li> Laser pointer: In this a laser is emitted from the input device to determine the intersection.</li>
                            <li> Gaze-based pointing: with this the headsets are used as the input device; it determines the userâ€™s gaze direction and defines the object to be selected.</li>
                        </ul></br>

                            <h4 class="post-subtitle">Volume-based Selection </h4>
                        <p>
                            Unlike the previous method this uses a 3D volume or container to select or interact with a group of data within the virtual environment. This method is useful in scenarios in which the user needs to select multiple objects at once, which can create a more efficient way of working.
                            The following are the 3 common ways to implement it:                          
                        </p> 
                        <ul>
                            <li> Sphere selection: a user defined spherical form that can be changed by a single point (the radius), all object that are within the volume are selected.</li>
                            <li> Box selection: a user defined box-shaped volume that can be changed at two opposite points.</li>
                            <li> Freeform selection: user can define any shape, by either drawing one or manipulation multiple points</li>
                        </ul></br>

                        <!-- Manipulation Pattern-->
                        <h3 class="post-subtitle">Manipulation Patterns</h3>
                        <h4 class="post-subtitle">Hand Manipulation (gestures)</h4>
                        <p>
                            This refers to the interaction with virtual objects by using hand or body movements, with this method the user can manipulate the objects using natural and intuitive movements. This allows for a more immersive familiar and natural way to interact with the environment.
                            This method requires a device that has sensors or cameras which can perform hand tracking and can be a complex procedure to implement.                          
                        </p> 
                        <ul>
                            <li> Hand tracking: Using sensors or cameras to track the user's hand movements and translate them into actions in the virtual environment. This can include basic gestures such as pinching, grasping, and pointing, as well as more complex gestures such as sign language.</li>
                            <li> Skeletal tracking: Using sensors or cameras to track the user's body movements and translate them into actions in the virtual environment. This can include actions such as reaching, bending, and twisting.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </br>
                        <h4 class="post-subtitle">Proxy Manipulation</h4>
                        <p>the manipulation of an object through a proxy as the object scaling might not be optimal for hand manipulation, for example when the object is too large to grab with the hand.
                        </p> </br>                        
                        <h4 class="post-subtitle">3D Tool</h4>
                        <p>This method manipulates objects with the help of an intermediary 3D tool. This method can be often found in applications in which VR (3D) painting can be made (example Painting VR). The 3D tools can be used to create, edit, or manipulate objects, by using hand gestures, body movements or other input methods. This is a useful method for developing design, modeling, and animations.                           
                        </p> </br>
                        
                        <!-- Indirect Control Pattern-->
                        <h3 class="post-subtitle">Indirect Control Pattern</h3>
                        <h4 class="post-subtitle">Widget and Panels</h4>
                        <p>This method refers to the interaction with GUI elements, this can be buttons, textboxes menus, etc. The choice for this pattern highly depends on the requirements of the environment and user, it is best to select ones that are most intuitive, efficient, and easy to use. </p>
                        </br>
                        <h4 class="post-subtitle">Non-spatial Interaction</h4>
                        <p>This method does not rely on the userâ€™s physical movements, instead the input methods are used. These methods can include voice commands, gaze, and button. This is a great alternative for users that are not able to move or use hand gesture, therefore it is useful to have this method implemented into applications to make it more accessible and divers.
                            The following are examples of non-spatial interactions:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Voice commands: This method allows users to interact with the virtual environment using spoken commands, which are translated into actions in the virtual environment using speech recognition technology.</li>
                            <li> Gaze-based interaction: This method allows users to interact with the virtual environment using their gaze direction, by using eye-tracking technology to detect the point where the user is looking and using it to activate or select interface elements.</li>
                            <li> Button-based interaction: This method allows users to interact with the virtual environment using buttons, such as those on a controller or other input device. The buttons can be used to navigate the virtual environment, select objects, and manipulate 3D tools.</li>
                            <li> Non-spatial interaction can also include touch screens and other forms of input that don't rely on the user's physical location or movements.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </br>
                        
                        <!-- Compound Pattern-->
                        <h3 class="post-subtitle">Compound Pattern</h3>
                        <h4 class="post-subtitle">Hand Pointing Pattern </h4> 
                        <p>This is the combination of hand and pointing selection pattern, the userâ€™s hands or fingers are visualized in the VR environment and their real time actions will be mimicked. The headsets are used to track the hands and their direction. This pattern provides a more natural feel to the interaction due to the familiar gesture and allows the user to easily manipulate objects that are in the distance or are of small size.
                            Just like the Hand manipulation, this method requires a device that has sensors or cameras which can perform hand tracking.                              
                        </p> </br>
                        <h4 class="post-subtitle">World in Miniature Pattern</h4>
                        <p>Combination of proxy, multi-touch (see in Navgation Patterns) and automation, in which the user can swap between exocentric and first-person viewpoints.
                        </p> </br>
